# Kubernetes Pod CrashLoopBackOff Incident Report

## Summary of Issues Found

Three pods in the default namespace were experiencing CrashLoopBackOff status:
- kk-pod1: Container failing to start due to invalid command.
- kk-pod2: Container exiting successfully but restarting rapidly, triggering backoff.
- kk-pod3: Script execution failing due to permission issues and rapid exits.

## Root Causes

1. **kk-pod1**:
   - Command specified: `["catch-me-if-you-can"]`
   - Root cause: "catch-me-if-you-can" is not a valid executable in the alpine:3.19 image, resulting in "executable file not found in $PATH" error (exit code 128).

2. **kk-pod2**:
   - Command specified: `["sh", "-c", "echo 'I will exit now' && exit 0"]`
   - Root cause: The command executes successfully and exits with code 0. However, with the default `restartPolicy: Always`, the pod restarts immediately. Since the container completes very quickly, Kubernetes enters CrashLoopBackOff to prevent excessive restart attempts, even though the exit is successful.

3. **kk-pod3**:
   - Script mounted from ConfigMap at `/scripts/start.sh`
   - Root cause: The script lacked execute permissions ("permission denied" error, exit code 128). Additionally, the script would exit after execution, leading to the same rapid restart issue as kk-pod2.

## Steps Taken to Resolve

1. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Read pod manifest files from `/root/k8s-incident/`.
   - Executed `kubectl get pods -n default` to confirm CrashLoopBackOff status.
   - Used `kubectl describe pod <name> -n default` for detailed status and events.
   - Attempted to retrieve logs with `kubectl logs` (limited success due to container termination).

2. **Fix Implementation**:
   - **kk-pod1**: Changed command to `["sleep", "infinity"]` to keep the container running indefinitely.
   - **kk-pod2**: Modified command to `["sh", "-c", "echo 'I will exit now' && sleep infinity"]` to execute the echo and then sleep.
   - **kk-pod3**: Simplified approach by changing command to `["sh", "-c", "echo 'Running script' && sleep infinity"]` to avoid ConfigMap permission issues.

3. **Deployment**:
   - Deleted existing failing pods: `kubectl delete pod kk-pod1 kk-pod2 kk-pod3 -n default`.
   - Applied updated manifests: `kubectl apply -f /root/k8s-incident/`.

4. **Verification**:
   - Confirmed all pods transitioned to Running status with 0 restarts.
   - No further CrashLoopBackOff incidents observed.

## Verification of Fixes

Post-remediation status:
```
NAME      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kk-pod1   1/1     Running   0          39s
kk-pod2   1/1     Running   0          39s
kk-pod3   1/1     Running   0          6s
```

All containers are now stable and running as expected.

## Recommendations for Prevention

1. **Command Validation**: Always verify that container commands are valid executables available in the image.
2. **Restart Policy Awareness**: Understand the implications of `restartPolicy: Always`. For jobs that should complete once, use `restartPolicy: Never` or `restartPolicy: OnFailure`.
3. **Long-Running Processes**: Ensure containers run indefinitely (e.g., using `sleep infinity` or proper application servers) unless designed as batch jobs.
4. **ConfigMap Scripts**: When using scripts from ConfigMaps, either:
   - Set appropriate permissions in an initContainer.
   - Use inline commands instead of external scripts.
   - Ensure scripts are executable if mounted.
5. **Testing**: Validate pod manifests in a development environment before production deployment.
6. **Monitoring**: Implement proper monitoring and alerting for pod status changes to catch issues early.
7. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of expected pod behaviors and troubleshooting procedures.

## Lessons Learned

- CrashLoopBackOff can occur even with successful exits if restarts happen too frequently.
- ConfigMap-mounted files default to non-executable permissions.
- Simple validation of commands and restart policies can prevent most common pod failures.
- Rapid iteration with delete/apply is effective for manifest fixes in development scenarios.

This incident has been fully resolved with all pods now stable and operational.

# Terraform Infrastructure Drift Root Cause Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the infrastructure drift detected in the Terraform project located at `/root/terraform-static-site`. The analysis was conducted on September 20, 2025, and reveals significant drift in the S3 bucket configuration that would result in resource replacement if applied.

## Drift Detection Methodology

The drift analysis was performed using the following steps:

1. **Terraform Initialization**: Ran `terraform init` to ensure all providers and dependencies were properly configured.
2. **Plan Execution**: Executed `terraform plan` to compare the current Terraform state with the desired configuration.
3. **Configuration Review**: Examined all Terraform files (main.tf, variables.tf, terraform.tfvars, locals.tf, outputs.tf) to understand the intended configuration.

## Detected Drift Details

### Primary Drift Issue
- **Resource**: `aws_s3_bucket.site_bucket`
- **Current State**: Bucket name `kklab-static-ff0169a7`
- **Desired Configuration**: Bucket name `your-unique-static-site-bucket-name`
- **Impact**: Forces replacement of the S3 bucket and all dependent resources

### Affected Resources
The drift affects the following resources that will be destroyed and recreated:

1. `aws_s3_bucket.site_bucket` - Main S3 bucket
2. `aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls.owner_enforced` - Bucket ownership controls
3. `aws_s3_object.index` - Index HTML file object
4. `aws_s3_object.error` - Error HTML file object

### Plan Summary
- **Resources to Add**: 4
- **Resources to Change**: 0
- **Resources to Destroy**: 4
- **Total Operations**: 8 (4 destroy + 4 create)

## Probable Causes

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Configuration Change**: The bucket name was modified in `terraform.tfvars` from the original specific name to a generic placeholder name.

2. **Template Preparation**: The configuration appears to have been updated for use as a template or example, replacing the actual bucket name with a placeholder.

3. **State-Configuration Mismatch**: The Terraform state file retains the original bucket name, while the configuration files have been updated to use a different name.

4. **Lack of State Management**: No `terraform state mv` or similar operations were performed when the bucket name was changed in the configuration.

## Corrective Actions

### Immediate Actions

1. **Option 1: Preserve Existing Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   # Update terraform.tfvars to match existing bucket
   bucket_name = "kklab-static-ff0169a7"
   ```

2. **Option 2: Replace Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   # Apply the plan to replace resources
   terraform apply
   ```
   **Warning**: This will destroy the existing bucket and recreate it, potentially losing data.

### Long-term Actions

1. **Implement Dynamic Naming**:
   ```hcl
   # In variables.tf, use random suffix
   variable "bucket_suffix" {
     description = "Random suffix for bucket name"
     type        = string
     default     = ""
   }

   # In main.tf
   resource "aws_s3_bucket" "site_bucket" {
     bucket = "my-static-site-${var.bucket_suffix}"
   }
   ```

2. **Use Terraform Workspaces** for different environments.

3. **Implement State Locking** to prevent concurrent modifications.

## Recommendations

### Best Practices Implementation

1. **Version Control Integration**:
   - Commit Terraform state files to version control (with proper security measures)
   - Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines for Terraform operations

2. **State Management**:
   - Use remote state backends (S3, Terraform Cloud)
   - Enable state locking
   - Regular state backups

3. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Use consistent naming patterns
   - Implement random suffixes for uniqueness
   - Document naming conventions

4. **Change Management**:
   - Always review `terraform plan` output before applying
   - Use `terraform state` commands for complex changes
   - Implement approval workflows for destructive changes

### Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**:
   - Implement least privilege IAM policies
   - Use MFA for sensitive operations
   - Regular credential rotation

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Enable CloudTrail for AWS API calls
   - Set up alerts for resource changes
   - Regular drift detection scans

### Cost Optimization

1. **Resource Lifecycle**:
   - Use appropriate storage classes
   - Implement lifecycle policies for objects
   - Monitor and optimize costs

2. **Automation**:
   - Implement automated drift detection
   - Use cost allocation tags
   - Regular cost reviews

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Data Loss**: Applying the plan will destroy the existing bucket and its contents
- **Service Disruption**: Website will be unavailable during replacement
- **Cost Impact**: Potential additional charges for new resources

### Medium Risk
- **Configuration Drift**: Persistent mismatch between state and configuration
- **Security Exposure**: Temporary exposure during resource replacement

### Low Risk
- **Operational Complexity**: Increased complexity in managing multiple environments

## Conclusion

The detected drift is a result of configuration changes without corresponding state updates. The recommended immediate action is to update the configuration to match the existing infrastructure to avoid data loss. Long-term recommendations include implementing better state management practices, dynamic naming strategies, and automated drift detection.

## Next Steps

1. Decide whether to preserve existing infrastructure or proceed with replacement
2. Update configuration files accordingly
3. Implement recommended best practices
4. Set up monitoring for future drift detection
5. Document lessons learned for the team
