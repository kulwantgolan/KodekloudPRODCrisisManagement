TASK 2: 
============
How many open issues do I have in my plane instance?  

TASK 3: cd /root/k8s-incident 
=================
Use the kubernetes-specialist agent to investigate and resolve pod failures.
- Analyze the pods in the default namespace for CrashLoopBackOff issues, resource constraints, and configuration errors. Pod manifest files can be found at '/root/k8s-incident'.
- Apply the necessary fixes and ensure all the containers within a pod are restored to Running state after remediation.
- Perform root cause analysis (RCA) and document findings.
- Save the detailed incident report to /root/k8s-incident/incident-report.md.


Task 4: cd /root/terraform-static-site 
==================================

Use the cloud-architect agent to:

- Analyze the Terraform project in /root/terraform-static-site/ for infrastructure drift.
- Detect unmanaged or drifted resources and identify differences between Terraform state, configuration, and actual infrastructure.
- Reconcile the drift by executing the correct Terraform commands that bring the project back in sync.
- Generate a detailed Root Cause Analysis (RCA) report that explains:
  - What drift was detected
  - The probable causes
  - The corrective actions taken
  - Recommendations for preventing future drift

Save this RCA report as /root/terraform-static-site/terraform-drift-rca.md.


Task 5-1: Update Plane Tickets
==================================

Update the Plane tickets with relevant comments. Specifically:

- Summarize the incident details from /root/k8s-incident/incident-report.md and add a comment stating that the Kubernetes pod crashes have been resolved.
- Summarize the root cause analysis from /root/terraform-static-site/terraform-drift-rca.md and add a comment stating that the infrastructure drift has been corrected.

Ensure the comments are concise, professional, and suitable for updating tickets in Plane.


Task 5-2: Create executive summary from incident report
==================================

# Create comprehensive incident report
cat /root/k8s-incident/incident-report.md > /root/executive-summary.md
echo -e "\n---\n" >> /root/executive-summary.md
cat /root/terraform-static-site/terraform-drift-rca.md >> /root/executive-summary.md
